XcbKit is a Kit (SDK) for window managers developed in Objective-C.

Version: 0.0.8

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Actual status:

- It can draw a title bar for a frame

- It can move a window on the screen.

- It can maximize a window

- It can iconify/minimize a window

- It can resize from the right, left, top, bottom borders and bottom-right corner.

- It can restore maximized and iconified windows to the previous status

- It creates a preview of the iconified window

- It decorates a client window

- It handles destroy notify

- It started to handle some client message event (actually iconify)

- It started to be ICCCM and EWMH compliant

- It redraws title bars for unselected windows (below windows) 

- Added supports for a number of events

- Handle “WM_DELETE_WINDOW” client message to quit an App or close a window.

- Support of WM_NORMAL_HINTS

- Support for _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS


There are a lot of things to add, for example:

- Extended the ICCCM and EWHM support (permanent non-blocking feature for all the next releases). 

- Add x, - , and a maximize paint to the three buttons

- Add appropriate event handling.



Port to linux on GNUStep is the next step for the 0.0.8

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal:

Have a complete Object Oriented Window Manger, modern and simple, for Linux/FreeBSD desktop environments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How I'm developing it:

Actually I'm writing the code using Xcode 5.0.2 on OS X 10.9.5, probably the best place to have full compatibility with GNUstep.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is GNUstep:

GNUstep is a free and open source implementation of the OpenStep APIs, today known as Cocoa.

Some links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep
http://www.gnustep.org/

To be more accurate Cocoa is a proprietary implementation of the OpenStep APIs, while GNUstep is the free/open source one.

To make an idea with a comparison:

OpenJDK is a reimplementation open source of the JDK APIs.

OracleJDK is the proprietary implementation of the JDK APIs.

Easy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes on the tests:

Some of the tests, the testHow{something}, are just a place to see how the libraries (cairo and xcb) that I'm using works.

They are a good place to learn the differences and the conveniences!
