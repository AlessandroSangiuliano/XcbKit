XcbKit is a Kit (SDK) for window managers developed in Objective-C on the X11 protocol, mainly focusing GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.

Version: 0.0.17

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Actual status:

The actual status of XCBKit starts to be quite good. Time to tome the support for standars is increasing and as a consequence tools and framework like java and its SDK are getting better support.

Major events are handled and the code is improving in reliability and readability.

I'm focusing the work on make more generic some classes and removing some hardcoded stuff that i did write at the begin of this adventure, when i had totally no knowledge about x11 programming.

I'm not going any more to update the below section because you can gon guthub projects section to see on what i'm working on actually.


There are a lot of things to add, for example:

- Extended the ICCCM and EWHM support (permanent non-blocking feature for all the next releases, because standards are so many and they come with the time!). 

- Add x, - , and a maximize paint to the three buttons


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal:

Have a complete Object Oriented Window Manger, modern and simple, for Linux/FreeBSD desktop environments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How I'm developing it:

After I did start on Macos 10.9.5 and XCode 5.02, the port on GNUstep was completed. Actually I'm writing the code directily on linux and GNUstep configured with CLion for autocomplete and other features.

This software NEED to be used with ARC enabled + libobjc2 + clang.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is GNUstep:

GNUstep is a free and open source implementation of the OpenStep APIs, today known as Cocoa.

Some links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep
http://www.gnustep.org/

To be more accurate Cocoa is a proprietary implementation of the OpenStep APIs, while GNUstep is the free/open source one.

To make an idea with a comparison:

OpenJDK is a reimplementation open source of the JDK APIs.

OracleJDK is the proprietary implementation of the JDK APIs.

Easy!

Some notes on the tests:

Some of the tests, the testHow{something}, are just a place to see how the libraries (cairo and xcb) that I'm using works.

They are a good place to learn the differences and the conveniences!
