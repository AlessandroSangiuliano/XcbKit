XcbKit is a Kit (SDK) for window managers developed in Objective-C.

Version: 0.0.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Actual status:

- It can draw a title bar for a frame

- It can move a window on the screen.

There are a lot of things to add, for example:

- Handle a client window putting it in the Frame. This is easy to do the kit has a model to incorporate a client window in a decorated frame with a title bar.

- Make it to start to accomplish the ICCWM and EWHM.

Thes 2 points are the next step for the 0.0.3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal:

Have a complete Object Oriented Window Manger, modern and simple, for Linux/FreeBSD desktop environments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How I'm developing it:

Actually I'm writing the code using Xcode 5.0.2 on OS X 10.9.5, probably the best place to have full compatibility with GNUstep.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is GNUstep:

GNUstep is a free and open source implementation of the OpenStep APIs, today known as Cocoa.

Some links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep
http://www.gnustep.org/

To be more accurate Cocoa is a propetary implementation of the OpenStep APS, while GNUstep is the free/open source one.

To make an idea with a comparison:

OpenJDK is a reimplementation open source of the JDK APIs.

OracleJDK is the propetary implementation of the JDK APIs.

Easy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes on the tests:

Some of the tests, the testHow{something}, are just a place to see how the libraries (cairo and xcb) that I'm using works.

They are a good place to learn the differences and the conveniences!
